# Governance Charter

**Open Claw — Contribution-Weighted Governance**
Version 1.0 | February 2026

---

## Principles

1. **Contribution-weighted.** Governance power is proportional to verified contribution, not capital.
2. **Transparent.** All decisions, votes, finances, and rationale are public.
3. **Anti-capture.** No individual or group can accumulate disproportionate control.
4. **Mission-protective.** Governance exists to protect mission integrity, not slow innovation.

## Governance Weight

```
Governance Weight = Effective Token Weight × Activity Multiplier × Domain Expertise Factor
```

| Component | Description |
|-----------|------------|
| **Effective Token Weight** | Contribution volume × quality score × time factor |
| **Activity Multiplier** | Bonus for contributors active in the current period (1.0-1.5x) |
| **Domain Expertise Factor** | Additional weight on decisions within your demonstrated domain (1.0-2.0x) |

---

## Anti-Capture Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Weight ceiling** | No contributor can hold >5% of total governance weight |
| **Quadratic scaling** | Influence scales sub-linearly with token holdings |
| **Mandatory rotation** | Leadership roles rotate every 6-12 months |
| **Cooling periods** | 14-day comment period before voting on major decisions |
| **Fork rights** | Community can fork all open-source assets if governance is captured |

## Decision Categories

| Category | Threshold | Cooling Period | Examples |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| **Operational** | Simple majority (>50%) | 3 days | Bug fixes, routine maintenance, minor features |
| **Strategic** | Supermajority (>60%) | 7 days | New initiatives, architecture changes, partnerships |
| **Constitutional** | Supermajority (>75%) | 14 days | Mission changes, token mechanics, governance rules |
| **Emergency** | Rapid response committee | Immediate | Security incidents, critical failures |

---

## Rapid Response Committee

- 5 members elected by contribution-weighted vote
- 6-month terms, staggered rotation
- Authority limited to emergency actions
- All emergency decisions reviewed by full community within 72 hours

---

## Proposal Process

1. **Draft** — Submit proposal using the Governance Proposal issue template
2. **Discussion** — Community comments during cooling period
3. **Revision** — Proposer incorporates feedback
4. **Vote** — Contribution-weighted vote opens for 7 days
5. **Implementation** — Approved proposals are assigned and tracked
6. **Archive** — All proposals, votes, and outcomes are permanently recorded

---

## Financial Transparency

- Monthly financial reports published with full line-item detail
- Revenue allocation follows the published formula (40% contributors, 25% compute, 15% operations, 10% reserve, 10% education)
- Any change to allocation requires Constitutional-level approval (75%)
- All contributor payouts are recorded and auditable

---

## Amendment Process

This charter can be amended through the Constitutional decision process (75% supermajority, 14-day cooling period). Amendments are tracked in the repository git history.

*Governance exists to serve the mission. When it doesn't, change it.*
