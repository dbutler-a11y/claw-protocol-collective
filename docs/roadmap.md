# Roadmap

**The Claw Protocol Collective — From Theory to Execution**

---

## Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Objective:** Establish the minimum viable coordination infrastructure.

- [ ] Launch GitHub repository with paper, README, and contribution guidelines
- [ ] Set up community communication channels (Discord/Matrix)
- [ ] Draft and ratify initial governance charter
- [ ] Deploy first orchestration agent
- [ ] Create onboarding educational module ("Start Here" guide)
- [ ] Establish contribution tracking prototype (commit/PR logging)
- [ ] Open first batch of `good-first-issue` tasks
- [ ] Recruit 10 founding contributors

**Success criteria:** Active repo with 10+ contributors, working communication channels, and clear onboarding path.

## Phase 1: Agent Deployment (Months 2-3)

**Objective:** Deploy initial agent swarms and validate coordination architecture.

- [ ] Deploy research agent swarm (automated literature monitoring)
- [ ] Deploy code review agent (automated PR feedback)
- [ ] Deploy documentation agent (auto-generated docs from codebase)
- [ ] Implement contribution scoring v1 (dashboard with live scores)
- [ ] Launch first flagship initiative workstream (assistive robotics)
- [ ] Create 20+ actionable issues for flagship initiative
- [ ] Begin compute resource pooling (voluntary registration)
- [ ] Publish first community research digest

**Success criteria:** 3+ agents in production, scoring dashboard live, 25+ active contributors.

---

## Phase 2: Economic Foundation (Months 4-6)

**Objective:** Establish dual open-source/managed-services model.

- [ ] Release open-source agent toolkit v1.0 (published package with docs)
- [ ] Launch managed service pilot (agent orchestration for early customers)
- [ ] Implement token issuance system (contribution-linked distribution)
- [ ] First revenue distribution to contributors
- [ ] Expand education program (5+ learning modules)
- [ ] Launch mentorship matching system
- [ ] Publish first community research output (peer-reviewable)
- [ ] Second flagship initiative workstream (cancer research)

**Success criteria:** Revenue-generating managed service, token system operational, 50+ contributors.

---

## Phase 3: Scale (Months 7-12)

**Objective:** Scale infrastructure, deepen initiatives, approach compute independence.

- [ ] Deploy colocation compute infrastructure (2-3 rack deployments)
- [ ] Launch 3+ flagship initiative workstreams with active agent swarms
- [ ] Governance system v2 (contribution-weighted voting with quadratic scaling)
- [ ] Managed services generating sustainable revenue (covering operational costs)
- [ ] 100+ active contributors
- [ ] First external partnership (academic institution or NGO)
- [ ] Ethics review board operational
- [ ] Multi-language onboarding materials

**Success criteria:** Self-sustaining revenue, 100+ contributors, 3+ active flagship workstreams.

---

## Phase 4: Sovereignty (Year 2+)

**Objective:** Achieve compute sovereignty and institutional-scale impact.

- [ ] Community-governed compute cluster operational
- [ ] Flagship initiatives producing measurable, published outcomes
- [ ] Multiple managed service product lines
- [ ] Full-time contributors funded by community revenue
- [ ] Global contributor base across 10+ countries
- [ ] Formal ethics review board with published assessments
- [ ] Community data center planning/operational

**Success criteria:** Independent compute infrastructure, institutional-scale impact, self-sustaining ecosystem.

## How to Advance the Roadmap

Every checklist item above can become an issue. To move something forward:

1. Find an unchecked item that matches your skills
2. Open an issue (or claim an existing one) describing your approach
3. Do the work
4. Submit a PR referencing the roadmap item
5. Get reviewed, merged, and scored

**We ship iteratively.** Progress beats perfection. A working prototype today is worth more than a perfect design next month.
