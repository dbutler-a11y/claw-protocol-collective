## How to Advance the Roadmap

Every checklist item above can become an issue. To move something forward:

1. Find an unchecked item that matches your skills
2. Open an issue (or claim an existing one) describing your approach
3. Do the work
4. Submit a PR referencing the roadmap item
5. Get reviewed, merged, and scored

**We move at agent speed.** A coordinated community with agent swarms compresses years into months. What institutions debate in committees, we ship in sprints. Progress beats perfection. Velocity beats planning.
