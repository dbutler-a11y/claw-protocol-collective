# The Claw Protocol Collective

**Coordinated Intelligence for Human Advancement**

A community-led, agent-native framework for accelerated technological iteration, human advancement, and sustainable infrastructure.

---

## What Is The Claw Protocol Collective?

The Claw Protocol Collective is a coordination system where **human contributors and specialized AI agent swarms** operate as a unified problem-solving network. We organize the one resource that matters most: the asymmetric ability of technical communities to perceive, iterate on, and operationalize cutting-edge technology faster than any institution.

**This is not a company.** It is a contribution-weighted community with transparent governance, shared compute infrastructure, and a clear mission: direct coordinated intelligence toward problems that matter.

## How It Works

```
Contributors ──▶ Build agents, contribute compute, create research & tools
                         │
                         ▼
Agent Swarms ──▶ Thousands of specialized AI agents perform narrow tasks
                         │
                         ▼
Coordination ──▶ Orchestration layer routes work, tracks contributions
                         │
                         ▼
Impact ────────▶ Flagship initiatives: assistive robotics, cancer research,
                 biofeedback, satellite connectivity
                         │
                         ▼
Sustainability ▶ Open-source public goods + managed services = revenue
                 reinvested into contributors and compute
```

## Core Principles

| Principle | What It Means |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Contribution-led** | Power comes from what you build, not what you own |
| **Learning counts** | Studying, documenting, and teaching are valid contributions |
| **Agent-native** | Humans coordinate; agent swarms execute at scale |
| **Non-speculative** | Tokens represent work, not investment. Earned, never sold |
| **Compute sovereign** | We progressively own our infrastructure |
| **Transparent governance** | All decisions, scores, and finances are public |

## Flagship Initiatives

These are the long-horizon problems we're solving together:

### Assistive Robotics for Health & Aging
Open-source AI companion robots for Parkinson's disease and aging populations. Buildable for under $500. Agent swarms handle firmware, speech recognition, and clinical research synthesis.

### Cancer Research with Open Data & AI
Agent-driven literature review, cross-study analysis, and pattern detection across public cancer research datasets. Making institutional-scale research accessible to distributed contributors.

### Human Biofeedback & Nervous System Optimization
Open-source analysis pipelines for wearable sensor data — HRV, EEG, sleep architecture. Privacy-preserving federated learning across contributor datasets.

### Satellite Connectivity for Medical Devices
Open-source communication protocols enabling assistive and medical devices to operate in areas without terrestrial internet coverage.

## How to Contribute

Every contribution type matters. Pick what fits your skills:

| Contribution | Examples | Getting Started |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| **AI Agents** | Research agents, code review bots, orchestration tools | Browse [`agent-contribution`](../../issues?q=label%3Aagent-contribution) issues |
| **Compute** | GPU hours, server hosting, bandwidth | See [Compute Pooling Guide](docs/compute-pooling.md) |
| **Research** | Papers, data analysis, literature reviews | Browse [`research`](../../issues?q=label%3Aresearch) issues |
| **Code** | Libraries, tools, infrastructure | Browse [`good-first-issue`](../../issues?q=label%3Agood-first-issue) issues |
| **Education** | Tutorials, guides, documentation | See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) |
| **Governance** | Proposals, reviews, voting | See [Governance Charter](docs/governance.md) |

**New here?** Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — it walks you through your first contribution in 10 minutes.

## Contribution Scoring

Your contributions are tracked, tiered, and scored transparently. **Compute infrastructure investment earns the heaviest weight:**

```
Score = Base Score × Tier Multiplier
```

| Tier | Contribution Type | Multiplier |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Infrastructure Investment** (buy/fund compute) | **5x** |
| 2 | **Compute Donation** (donate GPU/CPU/storage) | **3x** |
| 3 | **Agent & Code** (build agents, tools, code) | **2x** |
| 4 | **Research & Knowledge** (papers, tutorials) | **1.5x** |
| 5 | **Community & Governance** (reviews, mentorship) | **1x** |

- **Compute is king** — those who fund infrastructure own the most influence and earn the most tokens
- **All contributions count** — even the lowest tier earns tokens and governance weight
- **Gaming is penalized** — volume without quality reduces your score
- **Infrastructure compounds** — hardware investments decay at half speed because they produce value for years

Scores determine governance weight, revenue share, and reputation. All scoring is public and auditable.

## Governance

Decisions are made by contributors, weighted by contribution quality:

- **No single contributor** can hold more than 5% governance weight
- **Quadratic scaling** amplifies smaller contributors
- **Mandatory rotation** on leadership roles (6-12 month terms)
- **All finances published** monthly with full detail
- **Fork rights** — if governance is captured, the community can fork everything
